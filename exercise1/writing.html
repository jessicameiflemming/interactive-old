      <section><p>I've lived in you for almost ten years and I hardly know you. I'm deciding how to leave you.</p>
      <p>It's surprisingly difficult.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For all of our differences you've become my home, memories locked
        within a scattering of blocks.</p>
      <p>But thrill is absent.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Instead there's a fog rolling in.</p>
      <p>Your winds come again as the sun slips away.</p></section>
      <br>

    <section>
      <p>I know your four-way stops - cars whose humans throw <em>right-of-way</em> out the window - pedestrians
        on the brink of death at every crossing.</p>
      <p>Your dogs and street trash. Your brunches and cocktails.</p>
      <p>Steep inclines and their knee-breaking descents. The sweet smell of jasmine that
        clings to rotting fences, pristine and decaying Victorians slammed side by side in
        neighborhoods atop subterranean rivers. That ever-present seismic uncertainty of
        impending retrofits.</p>
      <p>Your wealth, your bitcoin, your Eucalyptus and coffee.</p>
      <p>I walk the streets and stare through windows whose lights flicker beyond drawn
        broken blinds, Ikean gauze; spent days watching the sun shift through Folsom street elms.</p>
      <p>I choose blocks based on moods. I pick faces to toss grins towards in hopes of a return.</p>
      <p>I've run through your shadows with glee and fear. I've clutched my keys between each finger
        and passed a thousand eyes.</p>
      <p>You are not a kind city. But you aren't cruel, either.</p>
      <p>You're simply a mishmash of stucco and lath
        upon sand dunes and granite,
        ghost ships and burial grounds,
      <br>
        whose bars close early and trap us here in that blanket of mist that whispers <i>go home.</i> And we do.
      <br>Over and over again. <i>Another Campari please,</I>
      <br> melting away in the red light.</p>

    <section>
      <p>You are as impermanent as your weather and as fickle as your shade.</p>
      <p>You are not my city, but you'll belong to whoever claims you.</p>
      <p>Ownership brings a strange fight. Most fervent are those born and raised.</p>
      <p><em>Equity</em> is a word that rings through.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>But it seems a climb up Jones forever to get there.</p>
