      <h1>Dear San Francisco,</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      <p>I've lived in you for almost ten years and I hardly know you.</p>
      <p>I'm deciding how to leave you. It's surprisingly difficult.</p>
      <p>For all of our differences you've become my home, memories locked
        within a scattering of blocks. But thrill is absent.</p>
      <p>Instead there's a fog rolling in. Your winds come again as the sun slips away. </p>
      <p>I know your four-way stops â€“ cars whose humans throw <em>right-of-way</em> out the window. Pedestrians
        on the brink of death at every crossing.</p>
      <p>Your dogs and street trash. Your brunches and cocktails.</p>
      <p>Steep inclines and their knee-breaking descents. The sweet smell of jasmine clinging to rotting fences; those pristine and decaying Victorians slammed side by side in
        neighborhoods atop subterranean rivers. The ever-present seismic uncertainty of
        impending retrofits.</p>
      <p>Your wealth, your bitcoin, your Eucalyptus and coffee.</p>
      <p>I walk the streets staring through windows whose lights flicker beyond drawn
        broken blinds, Ikean gauze; spent days watching the sun shift through Folsom street elms.</p>
      <p>I choose blocks based on moods. I pick faces to toss grins towards in hopes of a return.</p>
      <p>I've run through your shadows with glee and fear. I've clutched my keys between each finger
        and passed a thousand eyes.</p>
      <p>You are not a kind city.</p>
      <p>But you aren't cruel, either.</p>
      <p>You're simply a mishmash of stucco and lath upon sand dunes and granite, ghost ships and burial grounds,
        <br>
        whose bars close early and trap us here in that blanket of mist, whispering <i>go home.</i> And we do.
      <br>Over and over again.</p>
      <p><i>Another Campari please, </I>melting away in the red light.</p>
      <p>You are as impermanent as your weather and as fickle as your shade.</p>
      <p>You are not my city, but you'll belong to whoever claims you, and ownership brings a strange fight.</p>
      <p>Most fervent are those born and raised.</p>
      <p><em>Equity</em> is a word that rings through.</p>
      <p>But it seems a climb up Jones forever to get there.</p>
